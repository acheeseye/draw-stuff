## Additional Comments
So to get Unity working on my laptop I had to: <br/>
1.) Install Android Studio which comes with the Android sdk <br/>
2.) Download tools_r25.2.5-windows zip file <br/>
3.) Replace tools file in Android sdk with above file <br/>
4.) Install jdk_8u171 file from Java <br/>
5.) Unity should automatically detect them <br/>
