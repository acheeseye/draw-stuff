CS 372 Spring 2018 Project 3

So to get Unity working on my laptop I had to:
1.) Install Android Studio which comes with the Android sdk
2.) Download tools_r25.2.5-windows zip file
3.) Replace tools file in Android sdk with above file
4.) Install jdk_8u171 file from Java
5.) Unity should automatically detect them
